Memory Telegram Bot Documentation
Overview
The Memory Telegram Bot is a Python-based application designed to interact with users on Telegram. Its primary function is to receive tweet links from users, fetch the tweet content, and store it in an AWS DynamoDB table named "Tweets". This bot allows users to save tweets directly from Telegram for future reference, effectively acting as a personal tweet memory bank.

1. Purpose and Features
Purpose
The Memory Telegram Bot serves as a personal assistant for users who want to save tweets for later reading or reference. By integrating with Telegram, the bot provides a convenient interface for users to interact without leaving their messaging app.

Features
Tweet Saving: Users can send tweet links to the bot, which then retrieves and stores the tweet content.
Support for Twitter and X.com Links: The bot recognizes links from both twitter.com and x.com.
Data Persistence: Stored tweets are saved in AWS DynamoDB, ensuring data is persisted reliably.
Scalability: Leveraging AWS services allows the bot to scale according to demand.
Ease of Use: Simple commands and interactions make it user-friendly.

User (Telegram) <--> Memory Telegram Bot <--> Twitter API
                                         |

                                     AWS DynamoDB
Components
Telegram Bot: The interface through which users interact. It receives messages and commands from users.
Bot Application: The core Python application that processes user input, interacts with the Twitter API, and communicates with AWS services.
Twitter API: Used to fetch tweet content based on the provided links.
AWS DynamoDB: A NoSQL database service that stores tweet data.
AWS EC2 Instance: Hosts the bot application, providing the computational resources needed.
3. Bot Workflow
User Interaction:
The user sends a /start command or a tweet link to the bot via Telegram.
Command Handling:
The bot recognizes the command or message and invokes the appropriate handler.
Tweet Processing:
If a tweet link is received, the bot extracts the tweet ID and fetches the tweet content using the Twitter API.
Data Storage:
The bot stores the tweet content and metadata in the AWS DynamoDB table.
Acknowledgment:
The bot sends a confirmation message back to the user.
4. Detailed Functionality
User Interaction
Starting the Bot:

Users initiate interaction by sending the /start command.
The bot responds with a welcome message and instructions.
Sending Tweet Links:

Users send tweet URLs directly to the bot.
Supported URL formats include:
https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890
https://x.com/username/status/1234567890
Tweet Processing
Extracting Tweet ID:
The bot parses the URL to extract the unique tweet ID.
Fetching Tweet Content:
Using the Twitter API (or web scraping if the API is not used), the bot retrieves the tweet's text, media, and metadata.
Error Handling:
If the tweet cannot be fetched (e.g., deleted or private), the bot informs the user.
Data Storage
AWS DynamoDB Table ("Tweets"):

Partition Key: UserID (Telegram user ID)
Sort Key: Timestamp (when the tweet was saved)
Attributes:
TweetID: The unique ID of the tweet.
Content: The text content of the tweet.
Media: Links to any media included in the tweet.
Username: The Twitter handle of the tweet's author.
URL: The original tweet URL.
Storing Process:

The bot compiles all relevant data into an item.
The item is saved to the DynamoDB table.
Data Retrieval (Future Enhancement):

Potential to allow users to retrieve saved tweets via commands.
5. Technologies Used
Programming Language
Python 3.8+
Libraries and Frameworks
python-telegram-bot: For interacting with the Telegram Bot API.
boto3: AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with DynamoDB.
python-dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
AWS Services
Amazon EC2: Virtual server for running the bot application.
Amazon DynamoDB: NoSQL database for storing tweets.
AWS IAM: Manages permissions and roles for accessing AWS services.
6. Configuration and Setup
Environment Variables
The bot uses environment variables for configuration to enhance security and flexibility.

BOT_TOKEN: Telegram bot token obtained from BotFather.
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: AWS region where DynamoDB is hosted (e.g., us-east-1).
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME: Name of the DynamoDB table (default is Tweets).
These can be set in:

A .env file in the project directory.
Environment variables exported in the shell or user profile.
The systemd service file if running as a service.
Dependencies
All Python dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Example requirements.txt:

plaintext
Copy code
python-telegram-bot==20.3
boto3==1.28.59
python-dotenv==0.21.1
Installation:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
7. Deployment
Steps Overview
Setup AWS EC2 Instance:

Launch an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2.
Configure security groups to allow SSH access from your IP.
Connect to the EC2 Instance:

Use SSH (Linux/Mac) or PuTTY (Windows) with the provided key pair.
Install Dependencies on EC2:

Update the system: sudo yum update -y
Install Git: sudo yum install git -y
Install Python 3.8+: sudo yum install python3.8 -y
Install virtualenv: sudo pip3 install virtualenv
Clone the Repository:

Navigate to the home directory: cd /home/ec2-user
Clone your project repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory.git
Setup the Virtual Environment:

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd memory
Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3.8 -m venv venv
Activate it:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install Python Dependencies:

Install packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:

Create a .env file or export variables in the shell.
Ensure the bot can access BOT_TOKEN, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, and DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME.
Run the Bot:

Test the bot manually:
bash
Copy code
python bot.py
Verify it's working via Telegram.
Run the Bot Continuously:

Use screen, tmux, nohup, or set up a systemd service.
Set Up AWS IAM Role:

Assign an IAM role to the EC2 instance with permissions to access DynamoDB.
Follow the principle of least privilege.
8. Security Considerations
API Tokens and Credentials:

Do not hardcode sensitive information.
Use environment variables to store credentials.
AWS Permissions:

Use IAM roles instead of access keys.
Grant only necessary permissions to the EC2 instance.
Secure SSH Access:

Disable password authentication.
Limit SSH access to specific IP addresses via security groups.
System Updates:

Regularly update the EC2 instance to apply security patches.
9. Future Enhancements
Tweet Retrieval:

Implement commands to allow users to retrieve and view saved tweets.
Error Handling Improvements:

Enhance error messages and exception handling for better user feedback.
Media Storage:

Optionally download and store media content from tweets.
Multi-user Support:

Ensure data is correctly partitioned per user for privacy.
Scalability:

Use AWS Lambda and API Gateway for a serverless architecture.
Implement auto-scaling policies for the EC2 instance.
Web Interface:

Develop a web interface for users to browse their saved tweets.
10. Conclusion
The Memory Telegram Bot provides a convenient way for users to save and store tweets directly from Telegram. By leveraging AWS services and Python, it offers a scalable and secure solution. With potential for future enhancements, the bot can evolve to provide even more functionality and convenience to its users.
